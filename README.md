# What is ITIL ?

*ITIL is a set of established practices for the IT Service Management domain that aims in aligning IT Services to the needs of a business. ITIL is an acronym and when lengthened, it stands for **Information Technology Infrastructure Library.***

- To undestand this concept better and the usefulness it brings to the IT Industry, imagine a holistic approach that has been undertaken, rather than having to envision each of the singular IT components in the IT industry. ITIL came about to allow businesses to collaborate within the IT team in order to deliver IT services to the relevant parties by applying the necessary best practices. This is made possible by some such benefits provided which are:

    - The reduction of the cost that the organization must bear such as for IT operations.
    - Enhancing the service delivery of IT, its efficiency, and the quality.
    - Increasing of business productivity.
    - Improvement with the ROI.
    - The customer satisfaction reaching a higher level.
    - There's a better management of the business risk and the service disruption, therefore problems are minimalized.
                 
- In such wise ITIL helps organizations improve their service levels. The context of service level defined here is the idea of organizations focussing on their assistance to customers and the activities involved in the formation. Activities include methods such as planning, designing, delivering, deploying, and the management of services. However, the primary goal of ITIL is to enhance efficiency and achieve a predicatble delivery of activity with a higher level of quality.

## A little history of ITIL?

- ITIL's first version was introduced in the year 1989 in order to standardize IT Service Management. Then came the second version in 2001 with the aim of a uniform structure for service delivery. Then in 2007 ITIL's third version was introduced with a new feature called feedback looping for service lifecycle. Then in 2011 an upgrade to version 3 was released to clarify the processes of the version. In 2019, the latest up to now was made known, and this provided a flexible and an integrated system for the effective management of IT-enabled services. Thus, ITIL has 5 revisions starting from ITIL v1 all the way up to ITIL v4.

- So as spoken of before, ITIL brings to the table for corporations greater reliability, improves the decision making process with a good payoff, the quality of service made better, and after all it's cost efficient.

## Versions of ITIL and their descriptions ##

#### ITIL v1 ####

- This version which is the first one, specified about the processors that are involved in service support like helpdesk management, change management, and software distribution. Companies and government agencies across the globe then, began adopting this framework in the early part of the 90s so that they could improve the IT Services and delivery capabilities. The version consists of four major concepts such as:
  - **Availability Management -** This ensured that IT Services (infrastructure, processes, tools, roles, and etc.) are available based on the business requirements.
  - **Capacity Management -** The aim is to focus and manage performance-based issues, related to both, services and resources. 
  - **Contingency Management -** Identified vulnerabilities which can help in preventing technologically harmful situations.
  - **Cost Management -** Useful in delivering and managing cost-effective IT assets and resources.

#### ITIL v2 ####

- This version of ITIL was published in the year 2001. This brought in focusses on the removal of duplicate entries, helped in improving the consistencies of topics, and the inclusion of new IT concepts. Primary concepts of this chronicle was problem management, release management, incident management, and much more. This second version consists of two major concepts, likely:
  - **Service Support -** It stated processes for controlling service interruptions.
  - **Service Delivery -** It has a set of principles, policies, and constraints which can be utilized for designing, building, and deploying of services delivered by service providers.


#### ITIL v3 ####

- Published in 2007, this narrative adopted more of a lifecycle approach to service management with a greater emphasis on IT's business integration. This is another upgrade and consists of 26 processes and functions, but concentration is more of the five major sections.
  
  - **Service Strategy -** The phase of understanding the client's requirements and how can the the prospect be helped.

#### ITIL v3 2011 ####

- This is the update of of ITIL v3. So this edition of ITIL is an improvement from the previous edition of it. It aimed at resoving the mistakes as well as inconsistencies in the text and the diagrams across the suite. This version underwent a lot of redesigning and use of a larger font determined to make ITIL a bit more readable to the viewer. This version majorly highlighted the service strategy volume, yet this doesn't have a lot of changes but contained a few updates. So the amended parts are:
  - **Service Strategy -** This is also called as the service strategy manager for individuals in the rank who creates and implements the IT strategy that aligns that with the business requirements.
  - **Service Design -** To cordinate activities across all designs and them implement technical standards to the service design process.

  - **Service Operation -** Ensuring that access for IT services are only permitted to authorized users and lessen any service failure. 
  - **Continual Service Improvement -** Making sure that the IT services are always in tact with the business needs. This has a clear and brief seven step model that has been brought in to the improvement process:
    1. Identifying the strategy for improvement.
    2. Defining what will be measured.
    3. Gathering of data.
    4. Processing of data.
    5. Analyzing the information.
    6. Presenting and using the information.
    7. Implementing the improvements.


#### ITIL v4 ####

- ITIL v4 was developed with the main goal of helping busineses to administer IT services using the most efficient methods. The version of ITIL can be utilized amongst a number of different frameworks such as agile, lean, and DevOps. The chronicle of ITIL consists of two major components, which is the four dimensions model and the ITIL service value system.

##### Four Dimensions Model #####
  1. **Organizations and People -** The persons in the organization must know what their roles and responsibilies are with a clear understanding of how they would add value to the workplace.                                                    
  2. **Information and Technology -** This consists of information, knowledge, techniues, and technologies thata re required for service management.
  3. **Partners and Suppliers -** Setting up of contracts and other agreements between the company and its partners. The bearing in here is the organizations dealing with ones like in design, deployment, delivery, support, and the continual improvement of services.
  4.  **Value streams and processes -** This is basically a series of steps that an organization abide to so the internal stakeholders are able to create as well as deliver products or services to a consumer. 
 
-   Something to bear in mind is that a well defined process can greatly improve productivity within the organization or across it. So it's vital that a corporation addresses all four dimension so that the service quality is maintained.

##### Service Value System (SVS) #####

-   This is a set of activities performed in a corperation to deliver a valuable output to the end-user or consumers. SVS included elements such as guiding principles, governance, the service value chain, and continual improvement and practices.

    -   **Guiding Principles -** A set of principles that help in providing a comprehensive understanding of how an organization should operate a service.
    -   **Governance -** This is about controlling as well as monitoring the organization with guiding principles or the own set of principles.
    -   **Service value chain -** A set of activities that the business performs, which can benifit the consumers with a valuable product or service.
    -   **Continual Improvement -** This is to ensure that IT services are continuously aligned with the customers expectations.

These are divided into three major categories, respectively, **General Management Practices, Service Management Practices, and the Technical Management Practices.
